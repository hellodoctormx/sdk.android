# HelloDoctor Android SDK

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/hellodoctormx/sdk.android.svg?maxAge=60)](https://github.com/hellodoctormx/sdk.android/releases)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/hellodoctormx/sdk.android)](https://github.com/hellodoctormx/sdk.android/blob/master/LICENSE)

The HelloDoctor Android SDK makes it easy to integrate HelloDoctor's telemedicine service directly within your own app. The SDK provides an Android Activity for incoming video calls, as well as a number of services to request and manage consultations and other HelloDoctor user data.

Get started with our  [example project](https://github.com/hellodoctormx/sdk.examples), or [ðŸ“˜ browse the SDK reference](https://docs.hellodoctor.mx).

## Features

**Telemedicine video calls**: The SDK handles almost everything regarding an active video call with minimal development within your own application code

**Request consultations**: Use the ConsultationService provided by the SDK to retrieve doctor availability and request a telemedicine video consultation

**UI Kit (in development)**: Native screens and elements to request, view and manage a user's consultations and other HelloDoctor data.

## Integration Components
* **HelloDoctor Server**
* **HelloDoctor SDK**
* **Your Server**
* **Your Application**

**Your server** will be responsible for:
* Creating corresponding (or "linked") HelloDoctor user accounts for your users
* Requesting session tokens for your client applications
* Forwarding webhook events for video calls to your devices as push notifications

**Your Application** will be responsible for:
* Requesting session tokens from your server for HelloDoctor service calls
* Handling push notifications and calling the corresponding SDK functions (e.g. when your device receives an `incomingVideoCall` webhook, your application must then call `IncomingVideoCallNotification.display` with the webhook event payload)
* Providing screens for scheduling and managing consultations (the SDK provides services for making the actual server requests)

## Integration Lifecycle
### User Creation/Authentication
![HelloDoctor Integration Guide - User Authentication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54091648/182129252-7c9109aa-a3ec-4c48-958c-d202a925107a.svg)

 1. **Request linked HelloDoctor user ID and server authentication token**
 2. **Check Your Database for existing linked HelloDoctor user ID**
 3. **Depending on whether the linked user already exists:**
		 a) If linked HelloDoctor user **exists**, request authentication token for linked user from **HelloDoctor Server**
		 b) If linked user **does not exist**, send request to **HelloDoctor Server** to create new user
 4. 1.  *(Only if new linked user was just created)* **Save new HelloDoctor user ID to linked user, and then request auth token** (3a above)
 5. **Return HelloDoctor user ID and authentication token to Your Device**
 6. **Request HelloDoctor access token to authenticate current session**


### Video calls
![HelloDoctor Integration Guide - Video Calls](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54091648/182129272-df4d6674-03b1-4921-a8ef-96bf2a8a05a0.svg)

 1. **HelloDoctor doctor user launches video call**
 2. **HelloDoctor Server notifies Your Server of incoming video call**
 3. **Your Server retrieves device tokens for Your user**
 4. **Your Server notifies Your Device of incoming call**
 5. **When Your user accepts the incoming video call, HelloDoctor SDK automatically requests the access token for the call from HelloDoctor Server**
 6. **The active video call is peer-to-peer between the devices except for connection state data - which is managed by Twilio - and ending the call**
	 - If the **app user ends the call**, the HelloDoctor SDK automatically handles notifying HelloDoctor Server/User that the call has ended 
	 - If the **HelloDoctor user ends the call**, Your Server will receive a notification of type `videoCallEnded`, and it should push that notification to Your Device to then be handled by the SDK


## Installation

### Android Requirements

* Android 8.0 (API level 26) and above
* [Android Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin) 7.2.2
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/releases/) 7.3.3+
* [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/)

### Android Configuration
Add GitHub Packages repository (*Will eventually be moved to Maven Central*)
```
def props = new Properties()  
file("gpr.properties").withInputStream { props.load(it) }

...

repositories {
	...
	
	maven {  
	  url = uri("https://maven.pkg.github.com/hellodoctormx/sdk.android")  
	    credentials {  
			username = props.getProperty("gpr.user")  
			password = props.getProperty("gpr.key")  
	    }  
	}
}
```

Add `gpr.properties` file, which contains the keys for the GitHub repository
```
gpr.user=<from setup config>
gpr.key=<from setup config>
```

Add `hellodoctor-native-sdk` to your `build.gradle` dependencies.

```
dependencies {
    implementation "com.hellodoctormx.sdk:hellodoctor-native-sdk:0.4.1"
}
```

### Server Configuration
To notify your devices of incoming video calls, you server will need to handle two webhook events delivered by HelloDoctor
* `incomingVideoCall`
* `videoCallEnded`

Both webhook events will arrive with the following payload:
```  
{
	type: "incomingVideoCall" | "videoCallEnded", 
	data: {  
		recipientUserID: <hellodoctor-user-id>,
		videoRoomSID: string,  
		consultationID: string,  
		callerDisplayName: string,  
		callerPhotoURL: string
	}
}
```

The `recipientUserID` will be the linked user's HelloDoctor user ID, which is generated earlier and must be stored in your database, so that you can forward the webhook payload to the correct user's device(s).

The webhook will also arrive with the following header:
```
{
	"X-Api-Key": <your-api-key>
}
```
This allows for an optional validation step on your server to verify that the webhook was sent from HelloDoctor.
*Due to its overly simplistic and largely insecure nature, a more robust validation scheme will be developed in the near future*
### API Key and Secret
During the integration setup process, you will receive an **API key** and **API secret** to authenticate your client and server.

## Getting Started

### Integration
Get started with our [example project](#examples), or [ðŸ“˜ browse the SDK reference](https://docs.hellodoctor.mx).

### Examples
- The [FoodPass example project](https://github.com/hellodoctormx/sdk.examples) demonstrates how to integrate and use our prebuilt ui, as well as the user authentication lifecycle
